- name: Demystifying the REST API
  about: Are you confused by REST APIs? Can't tell a PUT from a POST? No idea what a non-idempotent operation is? Despite their ubiquity, the details of what makes an API RESTful are often lost even on experienced developers. We'll cover the basics of the HTTP protocol that drives most REST services, break down the lingo, and clear up some misconceptions about this powerful and popular methodology.

- name: "Drinking from the Firehose: Real-Time Metrics"
  about: To understand an application’s performance, first you have to know what to measure. That’s the easy part. How do you take those measurements? Store them? Analyze them? Get them to the people who need them? Well, that’s where things get complicated, especially in the  high-traffic distributed systems of the modern web! Like careful scientists, we must observe our subjects without altering them, and we must report our findings quickly so that we have the data necessary to make smart choices about the health and growth of the system. Let’s explore the lessons learned by engineers at one of the world’s top web companies in their quest to find meaning at 5 MB/s. We’ll discuss the tools and techniques that enable the collection, indexing, and analysis of billions or more datapoints each hour, and learn how these same approaches can empower your applications and your business, no matter the scale.

- name: Hacking the Human Interface
  timeRequired: 45-60 minutes
  about: Humans are the most complex systems we work with on a regular basis. That complexity produces a huge variety of behaviors that can seem entirely unpredictable on the surface. Thankfully we have a powerful tool in our arsenal that we can use to understand and share the experiences of our fellow humans. Let's talk about how we can marshal that often-underutilized ability to unlock the true potential of human relationships, mediate conflict, inspire others, and forge a stronger connection with the world around us.

- name: "TDD: Team-Driven Development"
  timeRequired: 45-60 minutes
  about: Developing software as part of a team introduces a host of challenges. A strong, motivated development team working together can marshal the strengths and specialities of each of its members to create something much larger than the sum of its parts. Teams that don’t work together can drain resources and make the workplace a miserable place to spend the day. The fact is, strong teams need strong leaders, and strong leadership is something that each of us can cultivate within ourselves. No matter your experience level or seniority, if you work as part of a team, you have the capacity to help lead your colleagues toward success. We’ll discuss strategies for dealing with conflict, ideas on how to become stronger communicators, and ways to help you and your teammates get the best from one another.
