  talk:  Demystifying the REST API
  description: > 
    REST APIs are not always well understood. Let's get back to basics and talk about what REST is any why it makes the web a better place.
    RESTful APIs are all the rage in the web development community, but there's a surprising lack of consensus about how to build them the 
    right way. If you've ever been confused about whether to use PUT or POST, or found yourself wondering what the heck an unsafe 
    non-idempotent operation is, this talk will set you straight.

  talk: Designing Service Architectures for the Cloud
  description: >
    Service-Oriented Architecture is not a new concept but modern cloud computing platforms have given it new life. The flexibility of these 
    platforms allows us to break out of the usual scaling patterns and precisely target resources where and when we need them. By examining a 
    case study, we will explore some of the technologies and techniques needed to create scalable, reliable, responsive applications at any 
    scale.

  talk: RESTful Web Services with Silex
  description: >
    Silex is a lightweight micro-framework built on Symfony components. Don't let its small footprint fool you, though. Silex is powerful 
    enough to form the backbone of even the most complex service-oriented application. In this talk, I will cover the basics of creating a 
    Silex application, building service providers, and constructing RESTful controllers. From there, we'll more on to more advanced topics 
    such as composing and delivering hypermedia content, monitoring and profiling, logging, and service integration.
