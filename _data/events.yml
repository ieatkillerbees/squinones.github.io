#  talk:  Demystifying the REST API
#  description: >
#    REST APIs are not always well understood. Let's get back to basics and talk about what REST is any why it makes the web a better place.
#    RESTful APIs are all the rage in the web development community, but there's a surprising lack of consensus about how to build them the
#    right way. If you've ever been confused about whether to use PUT or POST, or found yourself wondering what the heck an unsafe
#    non-idempotent operation is, this talk will set you straight.

#  talk: Designing Service Architectures for the Cloud
#  description: >
#    Service-Oriented Architecture is not a new concept but modern cloud computing platforms have given it new life. The flexibility of these
#    platforms allows us to break out of the usual scaling patterns and precisely target resources where and when we need them. By examining a
#    case study, we will explore some of the technologies and techniques needed to create scalable, reliable, responsive applications at any
#    scale.

#  talk: RESTful Web Services with Silex
#  description: >
#    Silex is a lightweight micro-framework built on Symfony components. Don't let its small footprint fool you, though. Silex is powerful
#    enough to form the backbone of even the most complex service-oriented application. In this talk, I will cover the basics of creating a
#    Silex application, building service providers, and constructing RESTful controllers. From there, we'll more on to more advanced topics
#    such as composing and delivering hypermedia content, monitoring and profiling, logging, and service integration.

  talk: Getting Started with Varnish
  description: >
    Varnish is attracting an enormous amount of attention in the world of digital media lately and it absolutely has the capacity to revolutionize the way we deliver content. While very simple to install, Varnish’s real capacity lies in the powerful configuration language, VCL. In this tutorial, we’ll walk through the process of installing and configuring Varnish, explore the included VCL and the shared VCL repositories. Finally, we’ll dive in to the VCL itself and learn how to develop custom configurations that handle real-world use cases.

  talk: "TDD: Team-Driven Development"
  description: >
    Developing software as part of a team introduces a host of challenges. A strong, motivated development team working together can marshal the strengths and specialities of each of its members to create something much larger than the sum of its parts. Teams that don’t work together can drain resources and make the workplace a miserable place to spend the day. The fact is, strong teams need strong leaders, and strong leadership is something that each of us can cultivate within ourselves. No matter your experience level or seniority, if you work as part of a team, you have the capacity to help lead your colleagues toward success. We’ll discuss strategies for dealing with conflict, ideas on how to become stronger communicators, and ways to help you and your teammates get the best from one another.
