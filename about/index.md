<img src="/images/bmorephp_cropped.jpg" align="right" />I am a polyglot hacker, writer, and public speaker. A recognized expert on high-performance system design and
architecture, I've built software and led teams for some of the biggest names technology.

I frequently speak at technology conferences around the world, and I'm always excited for the chance to venture in to
new communities and talk about the kinds of personal and technical challenges we face. In 2014, I was honored to
participate in the White House Data Jam on STEM Workforce Quality, Flow, and Diversity and to be named by the
Huffington Post among the top Latin@s in American Media.
