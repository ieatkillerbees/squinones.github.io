I've been in the software engineering business for a long time, but until I was introduced to the PHP community, I never really cared to engage in the social aspect of this profession. I really feel that the PHP community is something unique. It's rare to find a community that stands on the firm foundation of long-established friendships that is also so incredibly welcoming to newcomers.

I am still staggered by the friendship and support that has been given to me by people in the PHP world. The commitment that people have in the PHP community to raise one another up and to share their triumphs and frustrations, should be a model towards which every tech community should aspire.

One great way to get involved is to attend Nomad PHP, a monthly on-line miniconf where devs come together to share their knowledge and experience. I am immeasurably proud to have the opportunity to team up with Nomad PHP this month and share something that I'm very passionate about. [Please join me April 17th at 8pm CDT to talk about the REST API, where it came from and where it's going, and how you can build better ones](http://nomadphp.com/2014/01/24/april-2014).

REST is more than just a buzzword in a recruiting email. It describes a pattern for organizing and delivering content that is tremendously appealing because of of its relative simplicity and low overhead. Understanding where the idea of REST comes from, and how established and emerging standards are used to construct REST APIs, will give you the edge you need to build highly effective APIs that are a breeze to scale, test, and maintain. You definitely don't want to miss it!
