I've been playing around with D3 a little bit to familiarize myself for an upcoming project and I stumbled upon
[PubNub's wordcloud demo](http://www.pubnub.com/blog/quick-word-cloud-from-a-chatroom-with-d3js/) and it gave me an idea.

These word clouds visualize the word frequency from the comments a joind.in user has received on any talks they may have given.

Here's mine:

Big thanks to [PubNub](http://www.pubnub.com), Jason Davies and his [d3-cloud](https://github.com/jasondavies/d3-cloud),
[Lorna Jane Mitchell](http://www.lornajane.net/) and the [Joind.in team](http://joind.in).
