title: A Quick Note About This Blog

I got a wild bug last week to move my blog to a github page, so here it is. The volume of content that I produce certainly did not warrent a place even on the shared host it was living on. Plus, I've been meaning to play around with Jekyll for ages, and really, what better place than this? Please understand that some older posts will be somewhat discombobulated by the conversion process and it's not likely that I'll fix them anytime soon.
