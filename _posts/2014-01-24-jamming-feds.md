"What on Earth is a Data Jam?" is precisely the question I asked myself yesterday afternoon when an email inviting me to participate in a White House Data Jam on STEM Workforce Quality, Flow, and Diversity landed in my inbox. Reading through some of the supplied documents made things only a little bit clearer. Despite the confusion and misgivings, I figured being asked if I want to come to a White House <em>anything</em> is a good enough reason to apply the Jim Halpert maxim and simply reply, "absolutely, I do."

So that's why at a shockingly early and frigid hour this morning, I found myself trudging down a quiet street in downtown Washington on my way to the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. After clearing security, I made my way upstairs to a large conference room, poured myself a cup of coffee (sweetened with splenda from yellow paper packets emblazoned with the Seal of the President of the United states!), and took a seat among a sea of a bunch of very, very smart people.

It was through the introduction that the point of all this finally became clear. I was aware of the Obama Administration's support for government open data initiatives, which I praised in a very detached, "hey, open data's cool" kinda way, but I was not at all in tune with the very real ways in which the Federal government is trying to put this stuff in to practice.

One of the big problems, as any open data advocate can tell you, is that governments amass just gigantic quantities of data in the course of their day-to-day... governing, but there aren't often clear ways to use it or even consistently access it. This is data, of course, that's held by the government in trust for the benefit of the the people as a whole, but it really doesn't do a lot of good to anyone if it's locked away in some database that no one's ever heard of.

And so this is where Data Jams come in. I think we're all so conditioned to see the government as hopelessly bureaucratic and glacial that something like a Data Jam is actually a little bit shocking. It's a simple concept: get a bunch of government stewards of various datasets, potential consumers of that data, entrepreneurs and other private sector people in closely related fields, and some software developers together in a room and come up with 5 or 10 really good, actionable ideas for making that data work for the American people.

Since I'm not so sure about the etiquette of these things, and some folks were already a little on edge having someone from POLITICO hanging around**, I won't go too deeply in to the proceedings, but I have to say that I was amazed by what we accomplished in 6 short hours together. Brainstorming with a neuroscientist, a senior manager in the Federal service, an open data specialist, other developers, and human resources gurus really stretched my brain out in weird ways that I have to say I really enjoyed. And coming away from it, I feel like we actually did hit on some good, practical ideas that have the potential to make the Federal service, and the American workforce in general, just a tiny bit better.

I guess most importantly to me, it was a reminder that we can all serve society in our own ways. Not all of us are meant to be soldiers or politicians or diplomats. I'm just simple programmer who really likes building cool APIs, and if I can help, anyone can.

_**I feel the need to make a strong disclaimer here that while I am employed by POLITICO, I'm in no way a journalist and I have no pretensions of being one. I have a tremendous amount of respect for my colleagues in the journalism organization at POLITICO and while I'm always proud to represent the company, my participation today was primarily as a member of the broader technology community._
