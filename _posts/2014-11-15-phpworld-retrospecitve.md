### From the folks who brought you...

The folks at [PHP Architect](http://www.phparch.net) have a well-deserved reputation for hosting amazing developer conferences. There are many PHP devs who consider php[tek] the one truly indispensable event of the year, and with good reason. With that in mind, it's easy to understand the palpable wave of excitement that washed over the PHP world when [Eli and crew](http://www.phparch.com/about/) announced php[world] at tek 14. 

I think the team was wise to not try and just hold an east coast version of tek. There are too many uncontrolled variables that make tek the amazing experience that it is, and I think that any kind of attempt at recreating that at another venue in another city would probably have seemed forced and artificial. Tek, after all, is tek, and there's nothing quite like tek. Instead they went with a different if no less intriguing approach. Bringing together all the disparate PHP user communities-- Drupal, Wordpress, Magento, Symfony, Joomla, Laravel, and Zend Framework, just to name a few-- is no small task, and the Architect team managed it flawlesslessly. If tek is a family reunion, world was a UN conference.

It was a fascinating and unique experience to see thought leaders from so many diverse communities together under one roof, but it was no novelty act. World definitely avoided the obvious trap of segregating the user groups in to different tracks. Instead it seems like they carefully selected talks to entice people to leave their comfort zones and reach out across divides. This all culminated in the closing keynote which featured the "greatest panel of all time," with core devs from the WordPress, Drupal, Magento, Joomla, Symfony, Laravel, and Zend Framework together on one stage.

### Breakout Stars
I can't talk about php[world] without mentioning the conference's breakout star. Yitzchok Willroth, the man behind the much-loved [@coderabbi](http://twitter.com/coderabbi) twitter account, brought the house down with his talk, [Talmudic Maxims to Maximize Your Growth as a Software Developer](https://joind.in/11879). Filled with humor and heart, and delivered with Yitzchok's signature lilting cadence, he struck a perfect balance between education and inspiration.

### Good Friends, Old and New
While php[architect] didn't set out to run an east coast tek, I'm happy to report that much of that family reunion type of feeling translated perfectly to this new venue. Much like our beloved Sheraton in Rosemont, the Sheraton Premiere in Tyson's Corner provided an intimate lobby as the conference's social hub. Small groups piled on to the couches and lounge chairs were a constant presence at all hours of the day and night. It was fantastic to see so many new faces in the crowd and I am positive that many of them will become permanent members of our PHP family.

### #KosherCon
I want to thank the folks at [Blue Star](http://www.bluestarkosher.com/) in Bethesda, MD for hosting our first ever #KosherCon dinner after Tutorial Day on Tuesday. The food was fantastic and the staff did everything in their power to make our large and (somewhat) rowdy group feel welcome.

### Closing Remarks
What more can I say? php[architect] has done it again. It's clear that php[world] has made a place for itself in our community calendar, and I cannot wait for next year.
