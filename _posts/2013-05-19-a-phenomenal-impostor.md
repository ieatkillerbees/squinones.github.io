I really wasn't sure what to expect as I boarded a plane to Chicago last week to attend [php tek 13](http://tek2013.phparch.com). Before setting out, I studied the schedule in detail and carefully planned out my track. I balanced my itinerary between talks that were relevant to my current projects and ones that just seemed interesting and fun. Though I've been writing code for more than a quarter-century, except for a brief period in the 90s MUD and MUSH communities, I have never made any effort to take part in the wider developer community. It's only been 18 months since I attended my very first user group. I have honestly never felt like I had anything to contribute. I never felt like I belonged. And as I settled in to seat 9D, I was a little bit terrified.

I'd love to say that the reasons for my self-imposed isolation have been varied and complicated, but that'd be a big fat lie. I just don't feel worthy, and I never have. My first "real" job in technology was a contract gig working on a custom database in the late 1990s. Through my work in the MUSH world, I had a good deal of experience with data management and I'd even worked with early versions of MySQL. After I'd transitioned in to a permanent position, my boss at that job told me that he had hired be because my CV was so broad even though I was very young. He thought that I'd be eager and quick to learn new things. Judging by my performance reviews, I don't think he felt like he misjudged.

The truly sad part of that story is that I've never told it to anyone. It's not that it's a secret, but thinking of it like that is very, very difficult for me. Usually when I talk about how I got started in software development, I am sure to mention that it was the height of the tech boom when jobs were plentiful and developers were not. I usually point out that the project I was hired to work on was several weeks behind when I started and the company was desperate to put a warm bottom in a seat. I mention that I'm a naturally gregarious person with a gift for spouting bullshit. All of those things may be true of course, but  if a company hired every candidate with a pulse and the ability to carry on a pleasant conversation, they probably wouldn't be far from bankruptcy.

I have told my version of that story to coworkers, friends, and even employers. Even worse, I've told that story to young kids just starting out in <em>their </em>careers! Imagine going to a senior developer in your own organization, looking for some assurance that you too can make it if you just work hard and keep learning, and their answer is "Nope! It's just dumb luck!" If anyone I've ever given that spiel to happens to read this, I am sorry.

The fact is, I have worked hard to build my career. I set a goal of never going to bed without more knowledge than I had when I woke up and I've only failed to meet it a handful of times. Yet I'd worked just as hard over the years, to construct similar justifications for almost every other job I've ever held. Of course I fooled that Fortune 500 company in to giving me a position writing code that touched millions of financial transactions every day. It makes total sense that I tricked a small software shop in to hiring me by submitting code samples that were, to be fair, probably better commented than most of the code I write. The morning I started at my current position, I obsessed over the technical interview I had with the other team leads, trying to figure out how I could have possibly bluffed my way in to a job.

And I did it all barely realizing how much I was hurting myself in the process.

Back at the conference last week, the one session I was most eager for was the mentorship summit on the first evening. For the first time in my career, I'm now directly responsible for developing other developers in addition to software. I take that responsibility very seriously and I want to be excellent at it. As I walked in to the auditorium, I never expected for a moment that my life was about to change for the better.

Sean Prunka, one of the presenters at the summit, came up to the podium and introduced his talk by reading the beginning of the <a title="Wikipedia: Impostor Syndrome" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome" target="_blank">Wikipedia entry on <strong>Impostor Syndrome</strong></a>. I'd heard the term before and never paid it much attention. Sean described his own experience and struggle I found myself listening in stunned silence. For my entire professional life, there had been this dark shroud around me. A circuit closed in my brain and I was struck with sudden clarity. I could see how my "dumb luck" stories were the first link in the chain around my neck. Every mailing-list question I had ever stopped myself from answering was a link. Every pull request I never sent was a link. Every job I talked myself out of applying for was a link.

At the conference party later that evening, I ran in to Sean and we talked about his presentation for a few minutes. He told me he'd originally planned to ask for a show of hands to visualize how many people are effected by impostor syndrome. He said he though a lot of the hands in that room would have gone up, and believe me, that room was packed with some of the most accomplished and respected developers and authors in the PHP universe. That image stuck with me as I met many of those people over the course of the conference. Without exception, they welcomed me without hesitation. Many encouraged me to get involved.

Each time, I found myself wondering if they would have raised their hand. And even if they wouldn't have, even if they didn't personally struggle with feeling like a fraud, I thought about how much courage they had just putting themselves out there. Anyone can serve the needs of their clients and employers, but it takes guts to expose yourself in the ways you need to when you commit to serve your peers. I discovered a new kind of admiration for a lot of the folks I met at tek13, and I don't think I can ever forget that.
