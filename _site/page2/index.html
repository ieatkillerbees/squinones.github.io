    <a href="/devops/2013/06/12/continuous-integration-deployment-with-php.html">Why you should consider Continuous Integration</a>
  </h1>

  <div>
    
		
    		<p>Last night at <a title="DCPHP Meetup" href="http://www.meetup.com/DC-PHP" target="_blank">DCPHP</a>, I gave a short "lightning" talk on <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/squinones/continuous-integration-and-deployment-with-php" target="_blank">Continuous Integration and Deployment</a> in the context of PHP applications. I really like the lightning talk format as it forces you to focus on the meat of your topic-- there's no time to get distracted by details. As great as that is, though, I wanted to expand a little on the subject and touch on some of the details that I couldn't include in my presentation.</p>
<h3>What is Continuous Integration?</h3>
<p>Continuous Integration is a grand-sounding name for a very simple concept. Every time you make a change to your application's code (or, at least, on a very frequent and recurring basis), you build and test the entire application. Each change is integrated in to the application immediately.</p>
<p>Of course building and testing your entire application after each and every commit seems like a big task, and it is. Because we're building so frequently, it's essential that our building and testing happens automatically. Human intervention in the process has to be limited only to occasions when a build fails. When everything builds successfully, it should happen in the background like magic.</p>
<h3>What's Wrong With Traditional Build/Deployment Practices?</h3>
<p>To answer that question, it's important that we think about everything that usually goes in to building and deploying an application, specifically a web-facing PHP application. Very often there are configuration files that need to be modified. Bootstrap scripts and autoloaders need to be updated. Sometimes we find ourselves writing scripts to move files around, or update databases.</p>
<p>Hopefully part of the process involves running some kind of automated tests.</p>
<p>And once all of that is done, and it's time to deploy, we find ourselves staring at an FTP client. Often we use our VCS as a deployment tool, which is great because typing 'svn update' is so simple, but how many of you have ever left a .git directory or some other VCS artifact hanging out there for the world to see?</p>
<p>Sometimes we're stuck copying and editing files by hand in production, which is the kind of thing that gives me nightmares.</p>
<p>To put it bluntly, building and pushing by hand sucks. It's extremely error-prone and however unintuitive it may sound, the more you do it, the more likely you are to screw something up. When it's two in the morning and you're tired and you've done it a million times before, your attention wanders. You forget a step. You push the wrong thing out to production or forget to run a database update script and now you have a fire on your hands. Several years ago I was manually moving a production application between two servers for routine maintenance. It was something I had done hundreds of times before. I forgot to scp a file over and brought the system up on a month-old copy of the database. It took two days to set things straight again. That was a lesson I don't think I could ever forget.</p>
<p>If that's not bad enough, doing it by hand encourages another kind of laziness. We're developers and when we see problems, it's in our nature to fix them. "It's just a simple fix," we'll tell ourselves. Maybe no one's noticed it's broken yet and a quick edit to that one file will save the headache of a problem report in the morning. Maybe we'll remember to commit the change to the repo as well, or maybe in six weeks that bug will show its ugly face again the next time someone deploys the unedited version of the code from git.</p>
<h3>There is a Better Way</h3>
<p>Continuous Integration is one of the practices of Extreme Programming and Agile Development. When you think about it, it's a perfect fit. Agile development is all about short, tight iterations. User story, enhancement, build, release. Lather, rinse, repeat. Martin Fowler and Kent Beck first described CI back in the late 90s and <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html" target="_blank">Martin's original article</a> is still essential reading for any team looking to adopt the practice.</p>
<p>Before you can get started with CI, though, you need to prepare your codebase. If you don't have automated tests, you're going to need them. Going continuous relies on having confidence in the state of the application and the only way to build that confidence is through automated, repeatable tests.</p>
<p>You're also going to need an environment that's as similar to production as is reasonably possible. Today, thanks to the ease of setting up virtual machines (what up, <a href="http://vagrantup.com" target="_blank">vagrant</a> and <a href="http://puphpet.com" target="_blank">puphpet</a>!?), there's no excuse to develop and test in Windows and then deploy on Linux anymore.</p>
<p>Once your codebase is ready, it's time to start automating your builds. There are tons of tools out there to handle build automation, from ye olde make(1) to rake and phing and ant and maven and so on. I'm personally a fan of phing (which is inspired by ant and php-focused), but feel free to use whatever you're most comfortable with.</p>
<p>While you're evaluating build automation tools, don't forget about your databases! If you use an RDBMS and don't use any database migration tools, start! Database migration tools are like version control for your database, and they provide a framework for deploying database changes in a sane way. Many major PHP frameworks include a migration tool, and there are plenty of standalone tools like <a href="http://dbdeploy.com/" target="_blank">dbdeploy</a>, <a href="http://www.liquibase.org/" target="_blank">liquibase</a>, and <a href="https://bitbucket.org/zzzeek/alembic" target="_blank">alembic</a> (it's not just for python projects!).</p>
<h3>Now the Real Decisions Have to be Made</h3>
<p>What does a good build look like? How much code needs to be covered by tests before you feel confident to deploy? Should a build fail because a developer failed to follow a coding standard or forgot to add auto-documentation tags to her comments? Should a build be considered successful even if the number of findings from your static analysis tool doubled since the last release?</p>
<p>These are questions that every team needs to answer for themselves, but when you think about it, having to consider what concrete, objective criteria need to be met before you deliver software is a great problem to have!</p>
<p>This is a good time to start looking at Continuous Integration servers. There are tons of them out there, both free and commercial, but they all perform essentially the same functions. The CI server is the tool that's going to monitor your VCS repository for changes, run your build automation scripts, notify your team when things go poorly, and kick off your deployments.</p>
<p>In a future article, we'll explore each of these stages in more detail, so stay tuned!</p>

Before setting out, I studied the schedule in detail and carefully planned out my track. I balanced my itinerary between talks that were relevant to my current projects and ones that just seemed interesting and fun. Though I've been writing code for more than a quarter-century, except for a brief period in the 90s MUD and MUSH communities, I have never made any effort to take part in the wider developer community. It's only been 18 months since I attended my very first user group. I have honestly never felt like I had anything to contribute. I never felt like I belonged. And as I settled in to seat 9D, I was a little bit terrified.</p>
<p>I'd love to say that the reasons for my self-imposed isolation have been varied and complicated, but that'd be a big fat lie. I just don't feel worthy, and I never have. My first "real" job in technology was a contract gig working on a custom database in the late 1990s. Through my work in the MUSH world, I had a good deal of experience with data management and I'd even worked with early versions of MySQL. After I'd transitioned in to a permanent position, my boss at that job told me that he had hired be because my CV was so broad even though I was very young. He thought that I'd be eager and quick to learn new things. Judging by my performance reviews, I don't think he felt like he misjudged.</p>
<p>The truly sad part of that story is that I've never told it to anyone. It's not that it's a secret, but thinking of it like that is very, very difficult for me. Usually when I talk about how I got started in software development, I am sure to mention that it was the height of the tech boom when jobs were plentiful and developers were not. I usually point out that the project I was hired to work on was several weeks behind when I started and the company was desperate to put a warm bottom in a seat. I mention that I'm a naturally gregarious person with a gift for spouting bullshit. All of those things may be true of course, but  if a company hired every candidate with a pulse and the ability to carry on a pleasant conversation, they probably wouldn't be far from bankruptcy.</p>
<p>I have told my version of that story to coworkers, friends, and even employers. Even worse, I've told that story to young kids just starting out in <em>their </em>careers! Imagine going to a senior developer in your own organization, looking for some assurance that you too can make it if you just work hard and keep learning, and their answer is "Nope! It's just dumb luck!" If anyone I've ever given that spiel to happens to read this, I am sorry.</p>
<p>The fact is, I have worked hard to build my career. I set a goal of never going to bed without more knowledge than I had when I woke up and I've only failed to meet it a handful of times. Yet I'd worked just as hard over the years, to construct similar justifications for almost every other job I've ever held. Of course I fooled that Fortune 500 company in to giving me a position writing code that touched millions of financial transactions every day. It makes total sense that I tricked a small software shop in to hiring me by submitting code samples that were, to be fair, probably better commented than most of the code I write. The morning I started at my current position, I obsessed over the technical interview I had with the other team leads, trying to figure out how I could have possibly bluffed my way in to a job.</p>
<p>And I did it all barely realizing how much I was hurting myself in the process.</p>
<p>Back at the conference last week, the one session I was most eager for was the mentorship summit on the first evening. For the first time in my career, I'm now directly responsible for developing other developers in addition to software. I take that responsibility very seriously and I want to be excellent at it. As I walked in to the auditorium, I never expected for a moment that my life was about to change for the better.</p>
<p>Sean Prunka, one of the presenters at the summit, came up to the podium and introduced his talk by reading the beginning of the <a title="Wikipedia: Impostor Syndrome" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome" target="_blank">Wikipedia entry on <strong>Impostor Syndrome</strong></a>. I'd heard the term before and never paid it much attention. Sean described his own experience and struggle I found myself listening in stunned silence. For my entire professional life, there had been this dark shroud around me. A circuit closed in my brain and I was struck with sudden clarity. I could see how my "dumb luck" stories were the first link in the chain around my neck. Every mailing-list question I had ever stopped myself from answering was a link. Every pull request I never sent was a link. Every job I talked myself out of applying for was a link.</p>
<div class="sq_wiki_content"><a class="sq_wiki" id="w_0" title="Impostor syndrome" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome">Impostor syndrome</a>
<div class="sq_wiki_text">The <span class="searchmatch">impostor</span> <span class="searchmatch">syndrome</span>, sometimes called <span class="searchmatch">impostor</span> phenomenon or fraud <span class="searchmatch">syndrome</span>, is a psychological phenomenon in which people are unable to <b>...</b></div>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 2em;"><span style="display: none;">.</span></div>
<p>At the conference party later that evening, I ran in to Sean and we talked about his presentation for a few minutes. He told me he'd originally planned to ask for a show of hands to visualize how many people are effected by impostor syndrome. He said he though a lot of the hands in that room would have gone up, and believe me, that room was packed with some of the most accomplished and respected developers and authors in the PHP universe. That image stuck with me as I met many of those people over the course of the conference. Without exception, they welcomed me without hesitation. Many encouraged me to get involved.</p>
<p>Each time, I found myself wondering if they would have raised their hand. And even if they wouldn't have, even if they didn't personally struggle with feeling like a fraud, I thought about how much courage they had just putting themselves out there. Anyone can serve the needs of their clients and employers, but it takes guts to expose yourself in the ways you need to when you commit to serve your peers. I discovered a new kind of admiration for a lot of the folks I met at tek13, and I don't think I can ever forget that.</p>
